# Generic implementation of GANs on MNIST Toy Dataset
This code refers to the generic implementation of GANs in PyTorch on MNIST Toy Dataset. The prupose of this project is to gain a hands on experience of how GANs work. 

## Trainer.ipynb 
Run this notebook to train GANs. You can experiment with different configiration of Generator & Discriminator. The results below correspond to just 50 epochs.


## RunTime.ipynb
Run this notebook to generate images once the GAN has been trained.
